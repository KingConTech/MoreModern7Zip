# More Modern 7-Zip

🌍 **[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README-EN.md)**

This project replaces the default file association icons and file manager skins of 7-Zip with more attractive ones, and adds associations for Jar and War files (~~a little extra~~).

The file association icons and file manager skins currently used were downloaded online for personal use. If the original authors see this repository, please contact me to add author information.
